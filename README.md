## Introduction

SafeSSH is a secure application designed to simplify the management of OpenSSH keys. It provides a user-friendly interface to securely store, retrieve, and manage your SSH keys. The application ensures the confidentiality and integrity of your keys through encryption and provides features like key generation, renaming, and deletion for seamless key management.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Securely log in and create an account to manage your SSH keys.
  
- **Key Storage:** Safely store private and public OpenSSH keys in an encrypted format.

- **Key Retrieval:** Download your keys using the decryption key for on-demand access.

- **Automatic Key Generation:** Generate SSH key pairs effortlessly, with options to store or generate only.

- **Key Renaming:** Rename server names for easier key identification and management.

- **Key Deletion:** Remove unnecessary keys with a single click for a clean and organized key repository.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** For building the user interface and interactive components.

- **Redis:** In-memory database for user authentication and authorization.

- **MongoDB Atlas:** Cloud-based database for efficient and secure file storage.

- **Python:** Core programming language for implementing key generation, encryption, and other functionalities.

- **APScheduler:** Background scheduler for automated tasks, such as periodic file cleanup.
